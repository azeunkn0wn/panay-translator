        Olotayan Island is a 53-hectare island in Capiz abundant in greenery surrounded by clear emerald sea waters teeming with marine life and pockets of white sand beaches. It is the best site for snorkeling, scuba diving and beach bumming with its notable white sand beaches mixed with crush corals and seashells. It is an inhabited island yet it seems like it’s in raw form since the locals are taking good care of the island. The name of the island comes from the native words “olo” which means head and “tyan” which means stomach and has a popular legend behind.

    <li><span style="font-size:x-large">Suhot Cave and Spring</span><br>
        Suhot Cave and Spring is one of the famous tourist spots in Capiz which is a favored destination among the locals. Onsite are open huts facing the developed spring pool wherein the cold and natural spring are coming out from the rock on the cave. A stone throw away from the spring pool is the Suhot Cave. Not that much interesting stalactites and stalagmite formations but still worth exploring to have some adventure. A 15-minute trek from Suhot Cave and Spring is another cave called Lahab Cave. Visitors may enjoy dipping or swimming on the refreshing spring or go spelunking on the nearby caves.
