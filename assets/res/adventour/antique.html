    <p><span style="font-size:xx-large"><b>Antique</b></span><br>
        One of the provinces in the Philippines famous for its mythical folk stories and unspoiled tourist spots. Perhaps, the “rumors” of the presence of these strange mythical creatures is one of the reasons why most of its tourist destinations are untouched and mostly unexplored. However, there are much known tourist spots in the province where its coastal areas on the west are blessed with white sand beaches, islands and sandbars. In addition, relaxation awaits in its cold springs, water falls, famous “Kawa Hot Bath” and more.
