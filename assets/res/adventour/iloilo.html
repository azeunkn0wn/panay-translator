        Bucari is a mildly popular tourist destination nestled in the mountains of Leon, Iloilo. It is known as the province’s “little Baguio” for its cool climate and highland attractions. Bucari is an excellent place to visit during the dry season since it offers an escape from the summer heat. Getting there takes at least two hours from Iloilo City. The road section from the outskirts of Leon town proper to Bucari largely remains a bumpy dirt road, which has limited it to the more adventurous.
